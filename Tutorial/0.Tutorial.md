# Tutorial on Blake/Standard Shader Mod
In this tutorial, it took a tight clothing worn on a character to demonstrate the using of this shader mod. In this tight clothing mod, the UV layout is quite similar to that of HS2 character's body, and this makes the textures referred in this tutorial quite similar to the overlay maps putting on character's body. This clothing mod involved in this tutorial can be found on: https://github.com/Blatke/Heels-with-Tight---HS2-AIS-mod.

After having selected an object on Workspace panel, open the MaterialEditor tab in Studio of HS2/AI-Shoujo, choose a proper material, click its pop-up shader menu and select Blake/Standard to load this shader, and the original shader used in this material is now substituted.

With this shader, you can at least achieve these following effects:

1. [MainTex (Albedo) with alpha color changing and cutout effect](https://github.com/Blatke/Standard-Shader-for-ME/blob/main/Tutorial/1.md)
2. [DetailAlbedoMap with replacing or blending with MainTex, and cutout](https://github.com/Blatke/Standard-Shader-for-ME/blob/main/Tutorial/2.md)
3. [OMS - occlusion, metallic and smoothness by different channels of a designated map](https://github.com/Blatke/Standard-Shader-for-ME/blob/main/Tutorial/3.md)
4. [Emission by a designated map](https://github.com/Blatke/Standard-Shader-for-ME/blob/main/Tutorial/4.md)
5. [Bump by a bump map and blurring its noise](https://github.com/Blatke/Standard-Shader-for-ME/blob/main/Tutorial/5.md)
6. [Erasing bumps by a designated mask](https://github.com/Blatke/Standard-Shader-for-ME/blob/main/Tutorial/6.md)
7. [Wetness and fluid mapped by a mask](https://github.com/Blatke/Standard-Shader-for-ME/blob/main/Tutorial/7.md)
8. [Display of pure colors as well as the texture from DetailAlbedoMap by the mapping of a mask](https://github.com/Blatke/Standard-Shader-for-ME/blob/main/Tutorial/8.md)
