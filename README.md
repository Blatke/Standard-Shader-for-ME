2. **Wet Effect**: It includes a section for adding a wet effect to the material, enhancing the realism and visual appeal.
3. **Fluid Effect**: The shader mod also supports the addition of fluid effects, with detailed adjustability supported by a mask.
4. **Color Masking**: It allows for the changing of original colors brought by tint and main texture with new colors mapped by a mask.
